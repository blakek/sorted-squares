# SortedSquares

> A silly project to test recursion in different languages

Not the real purpose of this, but the problem that's solved is taking a sorted
list of integers and returning a sorted list of squared integers. It's not
_that_ tricky, but:

-   if the first element is negative, its square can be larger than the last
    element of the input
-   `0` throws a wrench in some solutions

This was actually created to see what a solution may look like in different
languages. Each folder should be set up like a module and may contain several
implementations.
